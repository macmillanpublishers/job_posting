# Greetings Friend.

## We are Content Workflows at Macmillan.

### This is a job posting. 

Are you our new Editorial Workflows Specialist? What does that even mean? Read on!

## First, who are we?

### We're new!

Macmillan is [insert description]

The publishing industry is evolving, and we wanted to find the best ways to meet this evolution head-on.

But the books never stop and our people have jobs to do, so in 2013 we put together a whole new team just to focus on this.

### We’re still growing.

[timeline]

## Our mission

Help our people make even more high quality books with the best tools.

[img - books or something]

If a tool doesn't exist, we find a way to make it.

[img - whiteboarding? coding? thinking?]

### We want to build systems that don't suck

[book dominos?]

### And make beautiful things (books!)

[some of our favorite books]

### And have fun

[group high-five? goofing around?]

## Where are we?

### Technically, we're in IT

This doesn't mean we're all programmers, but we're definitely nerds.

### We work in the Flatiron building

[arrow pointing to 19 in the FIB]

The whole building is Macmillan's!

## The job, in brief:

### It's an environment of constant change!

If that doesn't sound awesome to you, then you can stop suffering through this weird job posting. We still want to be friends with you, though.

[Time lapse of 5th ave?]

### You will:

#### Help people do better

#### Help people make books

#### Find problems - make solutions - test tools - teach people

## Who are you?

### You're excited about…

#### Showing people new things

#### Discovering new developments in technology

#### The business of creating and distributing content

We could have just said "publishing", but WORDS, amirite?

[chart or illustration or something]

### You're really good at:

#### Book production & editorial processes

I mean, sure, we're changing and improving things, but you've got to understand where people are coming from and how they're doing their jobs.

#### Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign

We're trying to find the best ways to use these industry standard tools, but we're also experimenting with new tools, so the most important thing is for you to be good at...

#### Learning!

And teaching people the new things you've learned.

## What you'll be doing:

### Teaching people how to use the new tools and processes we develop

And finding new, fun ways to teach people.

Does this mean written documentation? Does it mean in-person classes? Does it mean video tutorials? You tell us!

### Figuring out how people want to work, and helping us use that information to everyone's advantage

### Working with us to visualize and implement a beautiful holistic workflow.

We want to fix _everything_. We're starting at the very beginning, so right now that means Microsoft Word, but next year it might mean markup-based toolchains or asset management or marketing packages or ?????

[drawing of us as borg - resistance is futile]

## Give us your ideas.
